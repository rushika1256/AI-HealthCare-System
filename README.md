## Required Dataset Files

Place the following dataset files in the root directory:

- `Training.csv`
- `medications.csv`
- `precautions_df.csv`
- `medicine.csv`

---

## Usage

```python
from diagnosis_system import AdvancedDiagnosisSystem

system = AdvancedDiagnosisSystem(
    disease_data_path='Training.csv',
    medication_data_path='medications.csv',
    precaution_data_path='precautions_df.csv',
    medicine_data_path='medicine.csv'
)

symptoms = "fever, headache, fatigue"
system.process_input(symptoms)
```

---

## How It Works

### Disease Prediction
A trained machine learning model analyzes symptoms and predicts the most probable disease.

### Medication Recommendation
Cosine similarity is used to match patient condition vectors with medication vectors.

```python
similarity_score = cosine_similarity(patient_vector, medication_vector)
```

### Reinforcement Learning (PPO)

- **State** → Patient symptoms  
- **Action** → Treatment recommendation  
- **Reward** → Patient recovery outcome  
- **Policy** → Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)

The system continuously improves recommendations through interaction.
